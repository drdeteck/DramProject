							William Grant was born on 19 December 1839 in his father's house in Dufftown. At seven he was sent to augment the family income by herding cattle at a farm on the upper reaches of the River Deveron. Apprenticed to a shoemaker and after a spell as a clerk, William took a job in 1866 as a book-keeper at Mortlach distillery. Immediately he set about learning the art of distilling and in a short time he was appointed clerk and manager.
							After almost twenty years of learning the art of distilling, William Grant resigned from his job at the Mortlach distillery and bought a field beneath the towering shadow of Balvenie Castle. He then drew up plans for his distillery and the foundation stone was laid in the autumn of 1886.
							William Grant remained active in the company until his death in 1923 at the age of 83.
